Dompdf: This is a popular, pure-PHP library that excels at converting HTML and CSS content into PDFs.
Pros: It's great for quick and simple jobs, especially if you already have styled HTML content (like an HTML table) you want to convert directly. It supports most CSS2.1 attributes.
Cons: It can be slower for large or complex documents and has limited support for modern CSS features like flexbox or grid layouts.
Best for: Generating invoices, reports, or other dynamic documents where you want to use standard HTML templating.
